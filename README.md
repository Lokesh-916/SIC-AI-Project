# SIC-AI-Project
This project was completed as my Capstone Project at Samsung Innovation Campus.

Speaker Recognition Using Deep Learning.

This project focuses on speaker recognition, where a neural network is trained to identify individuals based on their voice. It involves audio preprocessing, feature extraction (MFCCs), and model training using deep learning techniques.
